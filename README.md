## Personal Configuration  

This is my personal and minimal(i.e I don't know more than this) configuration for nvim,tmux and my bash shell, there is nothing special to see.

### What I configured:

- custom nvim configuraiton with bunch of plugins and bunch of keymaps and other
  general stuff (Mason for lsp,conform for formatting,Lazy as package manager)
- In tmux I just use catppuccin theme and configure it to bare minimum.
- And in bashrc file, even I don't know what's in there. I just write the one bash function to quickely go to my office directory and bunch of exports.
