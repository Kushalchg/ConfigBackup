## Personal Configurateion

This is my personal and minimal configuration for nvim,tmux and my bash shell, there is nothing special to see.


### What I configured:

- I use nvchad for my nvim configuration and with the help of that I added some extra LSP, and Treesheeter and formatter.

- In tmux I just use catppuccin theme and configure it to bare minimum.
- And in bashrc file, even I don't what's in there. I just write the one bash function to quickely go to my office directory and bunch of exports.
